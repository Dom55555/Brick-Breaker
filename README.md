# 🎮🏀  Game Description:
Cloud Breaker is a fresh and colorful twist on the classic brick breaker. Instead of bricks, you're smashing vibrant clouds in the sky using a bouncing basketball. Your paddle is a basketball hoop, and after breaking all clouds, you must catch the ball to finish the level — but don’t drop it!

##### Made with Unity 2022.3.52f1

### You can fully customize the challenge in the Settings:

- Number of cloud rows and columns

- Ball speed

- Paddle speed

- Chance of clouds spawning with higher levels (stronger colors)

### The harder you make it, the bigger your ***score multiplier*** — skilled players are rewarded!

# 🕹 Mechanics:

Use **A** and **D** to move the paddle left and right.

The ball bounces off surfaces and reflects off the paddle based on where it hits, allowing skilled control.

Clouds come in 7 color levels, from red (weak) to purple (strong). Higher levels take more hits to destroy.

Once all clouds are cleared, you must **catch** the ball to complete the level and earn bonus points.

You start with **3** lives. You lose a life if the ball falls off the screen.

The game ends when you run out of lives.

# 🏆 Scoring System:

Each cloud hit gives **1 point** multiplied by the **score multiplier**.

Bonus points are awarded for catching the ball at the end of a level.

The fewer lives you've lost, the higher the catch bonus.
