🎮 ##Game Description##:
Cloud Breaker is a fresh and colorful twist on the classic brick breaker. Instead of bricks, you're smashing vibrant clouds in the sky using a bouncing basketball. Your paddle is a basketball hoop, and after breaking all clouds, you must catch the ball to finish the level — but don’t drop it!

You can fully customize the challenge in the Settings:

Number of cloud rows and columns

Ball speed

Paddle speed

Chance of clouds spawning with higher levels (stronger colors)

The harder you make it, the bigger your score multiplier — skilled players are rewarded!

🕹 Mechanics:

Use A and D to move the paddle left and right.

The ball bounces off surfaces and reflects off the paddle based on where it hits, allowing skilled control.

Clouds come in 7 color levels, from red (weak) to purple (strong). Higher levels take more hits to destroy.

Once all clouds are cleared, you must catch the ball to complete the level and earn bonus points.

You start with 3 lives. You lose a life if the ball falls off the screen.

The game ends when you run out of lives.

🏆 Scoring System:

Each cloud hit gives 1 point multiplied by the score multiplier.

Bonus points are awarded for catching the ball at the end of a level.

The fewer lives you've lost, the higher the last catch bonus.
